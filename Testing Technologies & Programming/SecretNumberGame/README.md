<h1>Secred Number Game</h1>
<p>This program generates a random number between 1 and 20.</p>
<p>The user can enter their number and guess whatever number is being matched with the generated number.</p>
<p>If the numbers are the same, an appropriate message is printed on the screen, 
and the game is terminated.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if the user number is lower or higher, there is an appropriate message, 
and the user is instructed to enter another figure.</p> 
<p>This program has been written in the Phyton language because writing quick, 
short programs using this language is elementary.</p>
